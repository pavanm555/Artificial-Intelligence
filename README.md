## Python for DataScience

NumPy and pandas are two popular Python libraries that are widely used in data analysis, manipulation, and numerical computing tasks.
### NumPy
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
### Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

## Data Preprocessing in Machine learning

Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.
When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. So for this, we use data preprocessing task.
It involves below steps:
* Getting the dataset
* Importing libraries
* Importing datasets
* Finding Missing Data
* Encoding Categorical Data
* Splitting dataset into training and test set
* Feature scaling

## Neural Networks

## ANN Model

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms.
The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other.

## CNN Model

Convolutional Neural Network, is a deep learning model commonly used for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. It is designed to automatically learn and extract features from images using multiple layers of convolutional filters.
