## Python for DataScience

NumPy and pandas are two popular Python libraries that are widely used in data analysis, manipulation, and numerical computing tasks.
### NumPy
NumPy stands for Numerical Python.
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
### Pandas
Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.
It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

## Data Preprocessing in Machine learning

Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.
When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. So for this, we use data preprocessing task.
It involves below steps:
* Getting the dataset
* Importing libraries
* Importing datasets
* Finding Missing Data
* Encoding Categorical Data
* Splitting dataset into training and test set
* Feature scaling

## Neural Networks

## ANN Model

Neural networks, also known as artificial neural networks (ANNs), are a subset of machine learning and are at the heart of deep learning algorithms.
The term "Artificial neural network" refers to a biologically inspired sub-field of artificial intelligence modeled after the brain. An Artificial neural network is usually a computational network based on biological neural networks that construct the structure of the human brain. Similar to a human brain has neurons interconnected to each other.

## CNN Model

Convolutional Neural Network, is a deep learning model commonly used for image classification, object detection, and other computer vision tasks. It is designed to automatically learn and extract features from images using multiple layers of convolutional filters.
Layers of CNN: 
1.Input Layer
2.Convolutional Layer
3.Activation Layer
4.Pooling Layer
5.Dropout Layer
6.Fully Connected Layer
7.Output Layer

## Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model that has been trained on a large dataset is used as a starting point for solving a different but related task. Instead of training a model from scratch on a new dataset, transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from the pre-training to improve learning and performance on the new task.
Image Classification: VGGNet, ResNet, and InceptionNet

## LSTM

LSTM stands for Long Short-Term Memory, which is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture. LSTMs were designed to overcome the limitations of traditional RNNs in capturing and retaining long-term dependencies in sequential data.

In traditional RNNs, the main challenge is that information from earlier time steps tends to get diluted or vanish as it propagates through the recurrent connections, leading to difficulties in capturing long-range dependencies. LSTMs address this issue by introducing a more sophisticated memory cell that can selectively retain and update information over multiple time steps.

## NLP

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It involves the development of computational models and techniques to enable computers to understand, interpret, manipulate, and generate human language in a meaningful way.

## OpenCV

OpenCV is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides a wide range of functions and algorithms that enable developers to perform various tasks related to computer vision, image processing, and real-time analysis.

## YOLO

YOLO is a popular real-time object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. It divides the input image into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from the grid cells.
