# Python-for-DataScience

## NumPy and pandas are two popular Python libraries that are widely used in data analysis, manipulation, and numerical computing tasks.

## NumPy

NumPy stands for Numerical Python.

NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.

It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.

NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

## Pandas

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets.

It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

## Data Preprocessing in Machine learning

Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model.

When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across the clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put in a formatted way. So for this, we use data preprocessing task.

It involves below steps:

* Getting the dataset
* Importing libraries
* Importing datasets
* Finding Missing Data
* Encoding Categorical Data
* Splitting dataset into training and test set
* Feature scaling
